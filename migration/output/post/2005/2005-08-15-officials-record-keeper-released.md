McNelly SoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the release of our flagship product - Official’s Record Keeper (ORK).

Are you tired of manually managing your assignment calendar, tracking fees and payments and managing other aspects of being a sports official? If you are like most sports officials, you probably use a variety of systems to:

- Track your game assignments using either a paper-based or computer-based calendar
- Track payment for the contests you have officiated either in a spreadsheet or on your calendar along with your game assignments
- Track contracts by placing some symbol on your calendar indicating that a contract has been signed for a particular contest
- Track game reports by making photocopies of the reports and filing them away somewhere
- Flip through your calendar pages every year in order to determine how many contests you officiated at what level so you can re-register for the next year, request an upgrade or prove qualification for tournaments

Official’s Record Keeper (ORK) is an affordable software tool for sports officials that manages all relevant information; making it easier for you to know where you have been, where you should be going, how much you’ve been paid, how much you’re owed and what happened during each of your contests.

ORK Is not a software product for assigners; it’s designed to help sports officials maintain a complete record of all officiating related information.

The program runs on any Microsoft supported version of Microsoft Windows (Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003).
