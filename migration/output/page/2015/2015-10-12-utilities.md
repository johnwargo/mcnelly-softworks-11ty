# Password Generator

We're always looking for a secure and complicated password to use for various online user IDs. Here's a simple application we created that simplifies the process by just generating passwords for you. You tell the application how many characters you want for the password and it generates a new password every time you click the Generate Password button. You can [download the app here](http://mcnellysoftworks.com/ftp/PasswordGenerator.exe).
