McNelly SoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the release of the first major update to our flagship product - Official’s Record Keeper (ORK).

This updated version adds the following enhancements and new features:

- Reports – We have added a bunch of reports to this version. You can print detailed printouts of Game, Expense and Location details plus print any view in almost any manner
- Sticky Views – When you make a change to the layout of a view (games, locations or expenses) those changes stick until you reset the view back to its default setting; even if you leave the program. You can now make the ORK data views look the way you want them and they will stay that way
- Backup Utility – Many users were regularly backing up their ORK Program folder not realizing that they were not getting their data files as well. Since the program allows multiple users to use ORK on the same system, each user’s data files are stored in a special location created by Windows for each user. The new backup utility we added to ORK allows a user to backup their data to the ORK folder under the current user’s My Documents folder in Windows
- More default program options
- Enhanced keyboard input

The update is free for all customers.
