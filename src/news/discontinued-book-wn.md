_What Now? The Essential Guide for New Soccer Referees_ has been discontinued effective January 1, 2016. Since the book was published, dramatic changes have occurred in US Soccer Referee Training program which made large parts of the book obsolete. I wrote the book immediately after retiring as a Soccer Referee; so many years have passed since then that I don’t have the experience I’d need to update the book for the current state of Soccer officiating in the US.

For those who purchased the book, I hope that you found it useful. It was my first book and a lot of fun to write. It made me into a writer, I’ve since written 5 more books plus a series of magazine articles that were published into an anthology.
