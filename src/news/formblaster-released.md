McNelly SoftWorks, LLC is proud to announce the availability of our first commercial software product - FormBlaster.

FormBlaster is a sort of mail merge utility for email communications. If you are familiar with doing a mail merge in a word processing program – you know that with a normal mail merge you take some sort of data source such as a spreadsheet or database and merge it with a word processing document, using fields from the data source to populate fields on the word processing document. If the data source was a spreadsheet containing a list of members of a community organization, the word processing document could be a registration form for an event or membership renewal form. The mail merge allows you to create a document you can print that contains a separate section for every member; once the document has been printed, you can then stuff each member’s section in a separate envelope and mail them off to your members.

The program runs on any Microsoft supported version of Microsoft Windows (Windows ME, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows 2003). The document merge capabilities of the program support Adobe Acrobat and Microsoft Word formats.
